## Introduction

**Hello and welcome to my blog!** I'm an architecture enthusiast from Hong Kong who's interested in both buildings and computers. I started this site in June 2022 and I hope you'll enjoy reading my posts.

## Reason for creating this blog

I love discussing topics both online and in real life, and I also enjoy sharing my experiences with others. That's why I decided to create this blog.

## Expectations

While I aim to write at least one post per week, my studies are my top priority as I'm currently preparing for HKDSE. That said, I will do my best to balance my studies with extracurricular activities like programming.

In addition to sharing my thoughts online, I also hope to make new friends in real life and broaden my horizons. If you're interested in connecting, feel free to reach out!
