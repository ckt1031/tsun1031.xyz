I'm excited to announce News Fusion, my news aggregator platform! I've been using it for the past year to simplify my own news reading, and now it's open-source, free, and available for everyone to try. You can check it out [here](https://news.tsun1031.xyz).

## Background

The name "Fusion" reflects its purpose: to merge various news sources into one platform. Beyond just combining articles, my ultimate goal is to use AI to filter out the most important news for both myself and other users from the vast amount of daily information, presenting it all in one place.

This project marks my first time integrating multiple modern AI technologies into a single application. Under the hood, it leverages not only large language models but also embeddings and rerank models. For instance, I've been using Gemini 2.0 Flash for importance filtering, OpenAI's Text Embedding 3 (Small) for vectorization and similarity matching (to prevent duplicate news), and Cohere's Rerank model for an enhanced search experience. I finished the prototype right after my high school public exam, and it's been working great ever since. I've refactored this project multiple times using different languages like TypeScript, Python, and even GoLang. I'm currently back to TypeScript, but the core logic remains consistent.

## User Interface

The News Fusion homepage offers a clean layout, making it easy for users to read the day's important news.

It also provides different categories like World, Technology, and Business. More categories will be added in the future to meet diverse user demands.

## Future

My next step is to provide better coverage of worldwide news beyond just RSS feeds. I plan to integrate sources from social media platforms like Reddit and X (formerly Twitter).

Furthermore, it's important to offer specialized experiences, such as email notifications, mobile push alerts, and regular newsletters to keep users updated on key news and headlines. I also plan to expand news content to cover Finance, Sports, and Entertainment.

I have no plans to charge for this platform, as I want to understand how people prefer to consume news simply and how users interact with the platform. Please feel free to comment and review; I'd be very happy to hear your thoughts!
