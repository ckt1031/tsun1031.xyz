## HKDSE Result Release: A Celebration of Success ðŸŽŠ

Today marks the release of HKDSE results, and I'm thrilled to share that my performance has exceeded expectations. My scores are more than sufficient to secure a place in the **HKUST Faculty of Engineering (JS5200)** and even the **HKUST Engineering with extended major in Artificial Intelligence (JS5282)**.

I'm particularly pleased with my Chinese subject result, achieving a level 3. My HKDSE Best 5 score totals 22 (3 + 4 + 6 + 5 + 4 = 22), surpassing the requirements for local universities, which is an excellent outcome.

My performance in mathematics and physics was outstanding (In my standard lol). I achieved a 5* in mathematics and a 5 in physics, both of which are commendable results. However, I **didn't perform as well as I'd hoped in Mathematics Module 2**, only achieving a 3. This highlights the need to focus more on algebra and calculus as I prepare for my university journey.

Fortunately, my overall performance was recognized by my school. They gave special recognition to about 10+ students, including myself. I didn't think about it lol, like my Chinese reaching a 3.

### Friends' Performance

Unfortunately, some of my friends faced challenges. One of my friends struggled with Chinese, while another received a level 2 in English. These core subjects proved difficult for them despite their strengths in mathematics.

They may need to consider flexible adjustments for their desired majors, such as those offered by HKUST and HKU. I hope they can still join me at university so we can continue our friendships. ðŸ˜€

### My Performance

Honestly, I don't mind anyone commenting on my performance. I've dedicated most of my effort to Chinese and a few other subjects, so I'd like to share my performance here:

| Subject                            | Subject Level / Grade |

### Reflections on Academic Performance and Personal Growth

I often find myself comparing my academic performance to others. Seeing peers achieve top grades, such as all Level 5 or 5**, can make me feel inadequate. I admire their accomplishments, especially when they're on track for prestigious careers in medicine, law, or other professional fields. Scrolling through Instagram and Threads, I'm frequently reminded of these high achievers, which sometimes leaves me feeling weak or overwhelmed.

Recently, I've had a revelation: constantly measuring myself against others is unproductive. Everyone has their own path to follow. I'm grateful to those close to me who've pointed out that the real competition begins in university and continues as we enter the workforce.

While I await the JUPAS announcement, I've come to realize that our journey of growth and achievement is just beginning, not ending. This period before university is an opportunity to explore new interests and contribute to society. Engaging in volunteer work, for instance, can provide valuable experiences beyond what textbooks offer.

For now, I'm focusing on enjoying each day, discovering hobbies, and finding meaningful ways to spend my time. It will be great if you embrace personal growth and community involvement. This approach not only enriches my life but also prepares me for future challenges.

Remember, your unique journey is just starting. Make the most of it!

## Reflections on the Examination Experience

### The Power of Effective Note-Taking

Interestingly, no one teaches how to study efficiently for these exams. The key, I've discovered, lies in creating effective notes. I struggled with scientific subjects until Form 6, when I had a breakthrough.

As I mentioned in my blog, I began using digital notes and realized their superiority over paper notes. Text-based digital notes proved even more efficient than handwritten digital notes (like those in Goodnotes) due to faster querying capabilities on computers. Some software even allows linking between different documents, connecting past papers with knowledge points, and organizing everything into mind maps. This approach significantly improved my ability to review mistakes and remember key points more clearly.

Here's an example of using a mind map to link knowledge for a Physics chapter:

I could even track the Math MC topics where I frequently made mistakes:

This method helped me achieve ideal scores in Physics and Chemistry. I'm disappointed that schools didn't teach this approach, and even now, it's not widely taught. While my performance may not have been the absolute best, I'm confident this method is highly effective, not just for HKDSE but for any university major.

### Looking Back: What I'd Do Differently

If I could turn back time, I'd allocate more time to exploring different aspects of the world, even though I did attempt this to some extent. I'd focus more on diverse information and global news.

Additionally, I'd invest more time in various fields, especially the Internet, AI, programming, and creative pursuits. In this era of rapid technological advancement and AI development, we need a broader skill set to thrive and maintain independence. People with diverse knowledge across multiple fields are increasingly valuable in society.
